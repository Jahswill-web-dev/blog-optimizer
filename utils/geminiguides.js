const contentGuide = `Every great blog post needs a clear introduction that tells visitors what the post is about. This helps people decide whether they’re interested in the topic. Just like the headline, it’s not enough to simply state what the blog is about. You also need to make the visitor want to carry on reading and explain why the post is relevant to your audience. People don’t want to waste time on blogs they’re not interested in. Having said that, your introduction should be short and to the point. Ideally, you should aim for 1-3 paragraphs.

When it comes to creating a tight, focused introduction, a good trick is to try and include your blog’s keyword as early as possible. By sticking to this goal, you’ll be less likely to go off-topic. Depending on the kind of blog you’re writing, you may get good results by sharing interesting or surprising statistics in the introduction.

Content Guide

No matter how good your writing is, all your hard work will go to waste if readers can’t concentrate on more than a few paragraphs. That’s why we recommend using headings to break your post into bite-sized chunks.

Headings help readers skim the post and find the content they’re interested in reading. It also makes it easier for them to revisit sections they want to read again.

Before you start writing, it’s a good idea to map out all the headings you’ll use and the content you’ll add to each section. This will keep you focused as you write the post.

Ideally, your headings should summarize each major point you want to make. In fact, readers should be able to understand the flow of your blog simply by scanning the headings. Let’s look at an example. Here, we have some tips on how to store coffee beans correctly. Although each paragraph provides useful extra information, you can get all the tips just by reading the headings. You can also add bullet points.

Content Guide: A Table of Contents

A table of contents lists the post’s main points and provides links to specific sections. This gives visitors an overview of what the blog covers while allowing them to jump straight to the content they’re interested in. This can keep visitors on your website for longer, even if they’re only interested in part of a blog post.

A table of contents can even improve your WordPress SEO, as Google often uses the table to automatically add 'jump to section' links in search results.

Keep Paragraphs and Sentences Short

Imagine opening a blog post just to find a wall of text. Chances are, you'd leave the page immediately. That said, it's important to break your blog into short paragraphs and sentences. These are easier to skim and look much less daunting, especially on mobile devices.

A good trick is to avoid long and complicated words, intricate metaphors, and flowery language. All of that to say: keep it simple. You'll lose people if you try to be too clever.

Ideally, you should aim to make a single point per sentence, using as few words as possible. Often, you can break grammatical rules if it gets your point across in fewer words. This may mean starting sentences with things like 'Or,' 'And,' or 'But,' or using more casual language and fragments rather than full sentences.

You should also organize your sentences and paragraphs to give the reader the most important information first, and then go into finer detail from there. This makes it easier for the reader to skip sections they're not interested in.

Add Images, Video, and Other Media

Visitors don't want to feel like they're reading a novel when they visit your blog. With that in mind, it's a good idea to add visual content like photos, infographics, screenshots, graphs, and diagrams.

Immediately, this breaks up your text, but it also helps visitors see what each section is about, at a glance. Each piece of visual content is also another opportunity to grab the reader’s attention as they scroll through your post.

It even seems like blogs with visual content are more popular. According to our blogging statistics research, posts with more than seven images get 116% more organic traffic compared to posts that have no images. Similarly, blogs with videos get 83% more traffic than those without video.

If you're writing 'how to' blogs, then images help visitors understand what they need to do.

CTA (Call to Action)

When the reader reaches the end of the post, you need to tell them what to do next. This should be an action that keeps them engaged with your blog or gets them to convert, which is known as a call to action.

A good call to action is clear, asks for the user to take precise action, and has a sense of urgency. For example, you might ask them to download a PDF or subscribe to your email newsletter.

Even if you use the same call to action, it's a good idea to customize it for the individual post. In the following image, the interior design blog Decorilla uses its standard call to action, which encourages readers to schedule a free consultation using a booking form. However, they’ve tweaked the messaging to suit the blog’s topic, which is how to decorate a child’s bedroom.

If you're not sure what call to action to use, then ask yourself why you're writing this blog. If you want to get more comments, then you might ask readers to share their opinion or answer a question by posting it in the comment section.

You might even offer a reward for commenting, such as entering the reader into a giveaway or contest. For example, the example below gives readers a list of books and asks them to comment on which one they want to win.

Conclusion

A good conclusion summarizes all the points you've made throughout the blog, without introducing any new information.

Depending on the topic, you may sometimes want to suggest an actionable solution or share your top pick of all the products, WordPress plugins, travel destinations, and anything else you’ve compared or reviewed throughout the blog.

However, as a general rule conclusions tend to be pretty short, so don't worry if your conclusion is one or two sentences.
